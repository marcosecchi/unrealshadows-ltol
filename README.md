This project is based on the source code for my book [Multiplayer Game Development With Unreal Engine 5](https://www.amazon.com/Multiplayer-Game-Development-Unreal-Engine-ebook/dp/B0C85W64H2/) published by Packt.
It's an ongoing project adding more features to the original source code and keeping it up-to-date with the newer Unreal Engine versions.

**Note**: the original source code for the book can be found on [Packt GitHub repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Multiplayer-Game-Development-with-Unreal-Engine-5).
